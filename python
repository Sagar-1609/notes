we will start from writing a fucntion which is 
filename : first_python.py
def newfunction(n):
      print(n)

newfunction(4)

now this will print the fucntion

************

now we can create a another file filename:python12.py and import newfunction this function
syntax from [filename] import [function name]

from first_python import newfunction

and when we run  it will create a file caches 
a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)
Cool. But here’s the catch — your CPU doesn’t understand English, Hindi, or even “print.”
It only speaks binary (0s and 1s) — like:

Copy code
101010100110001010101010
So your nice readable code is useless to the computer — it needs a translator.

⚙️ STEP 2 — Python Interpreter = The Translator
When you hit “Run,” a program called the Python Interpreter starts working.
Think of it like a translator who reads your line:

css
Copy code
print(a + b)
and tells the computer, “Yo, this means add two numbers and print it.”

There are two kinds of translators in programming:

Compilers (like in C++) — translate the whole book (program) before running.

Interpreters (like Python) — translate one sentence at a time while running.

So Python reads → translates → executes → next line → repeat.

That’s why Python runs a bit slower than compiled languages — it’s thinking as it goes.
